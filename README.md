# Students-Database-Analysis
### Situation:
Analyzed a Students Database with four tables - students, bridge, chess, and music - to clean data and derive insightful metrics.

### Task:
Clean data (handle missing values, standardize dates) and thereby-
1. List the number of girls per district.
2. Determine max and min test scores of Class 1 students per district.
3. Compute average Math scores of boys per class, excluding classes with <3 boys.
4. Sort boys of Class 1A by name.
5. List 1B students by residential district.
6. List the number of students per district.
7. Organize and order boys by house and class.
8. Identify the top 10% scoring girls in Math.
9. Extract the second highest Math scorer.
10. Count unique student names.
11. Categorize students as dumb or scholar based on Math scores.
12. Find the 4th lowest, combined Math and Physics, scorer.
13. Assign roll numbers within each class alphabetically.
14. Further categorize students as Scholars, Average, and Dumbs.
15. Extract the higher of Math and Physics scores per student and identify the top scorer.
16. Calculate average age of boy students.
17. Create a monthly birthday frequency table.

### Action:
1. Implemented data cleaning using DDL and DML commands.
2. Applied GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, LIMIT, IF(), DISTINCT, GREATEST(), CTE, Aliases, IS NOT NULL, User-defined function, Aggregate Functions, and Window Functions.

### Result:
Provided valuable insights into student performance and demographics, demonstrating advanced SQL skills.
